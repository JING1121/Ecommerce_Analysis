# YOUKE- CUSTOMER BEHAVIORS ANALYSIS

## **Project Background**

YOUKE Tech, an e-commerce company established in 2018, specializes in selling popular electronics, including Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop, Smartwatch, Headphones. I collaborate with the Operations team to analyze data and provide actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing the performance of the sales, product, and marketing team.

## **Executive Summary**

---

YOUKE Tech‚Äôs sales analysis of 108k records from 2019 to 2022 reveals annual revenue stabilizing at approximately $7 million, approaching pre-COVID levels. North America and EMEA regions account for 80% of total sales, with Monitors and AirPods contributing 60% of the revenue. However, declining customer retention is a key concern, as unique purchase rates and repeat purchase rates have dropped by 15% and 10%, respectively.

To address these challenges, YOUKE Tech could focus on expanding its top-performing product lines, optimizing bundling strategies, and enhancing loyalty programs to boost customer lifetime value. Additionally, targeted growth initiatives in APAC and LATAM, combined with improvements in digital channels such as the mobile app, are essential for strengthening market presence and driving long-term sustainable growth.
